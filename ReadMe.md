Web Developer Code Test
-----------------------

Congrats on advancing to the next step in our hiring process!
For this test, we ask you to please build a version of the popular game
Connect Four using only HTML/CSS/Javascript. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)

Requirements:
-------------

● The game should be playable locally on a single screen by two players.
● A library such as jQuery can be used.
● UI library widgets (.e.g. jQuery UI) are prohibited.
● The game should make use of animations.
● There should be unit tests.
● CSS3 can be used.
● Cross-browser compliance is welcome but not required.

Please spend no more than 6 hours on it. Whatever features are complete,
ensure they work as designed and tested. A complete solution is less important
than a limited one with properly implemented functionality.
